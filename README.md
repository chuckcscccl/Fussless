### Fussless: Rustlr Target for F\#

"Fussless" is a parser generation system for F\# written in Rust as part of the
**[Rustlr](https://crates.io/crates/rustlr)** parser generator. This package contains the .Net end of the project, including the runtime parser and
routines to interpret the parsing tables generated by Rustlr.
Rustlr was originally designed to generate parsers for Rust and 
so far, only some of its capabilities are available for F# targets.  Notably,
there is no automatic generation of abstract syntax, nor is the -lrsd option
for using selective Marcus-Leermakers grammars currently available.  However,
the system does recognize the operators +, \*, ?, as well as the <\_*> and
<\_+> opertions and creates vectors (ResizeArray) for them.

It also contains an interface to lexical analyzers, which is written in C#,
although other tokenizers can be used by conforming to the AbstractLexer
interface.

Fussless can automatically generate a lexical analyzer in the form of
a .lex file from the grammar. The .lex file can be compiled by *CsLex*, which is
available at
[https://github.com/zbrad/CsLex](https://github.com/zbrad/CsLex)


The contents of this directory are as follows:

- **RuntimeParser.fs** : This is the main implementation of the F# side of
  Rustlr/Fussless.  Currently, there are limitations to the runtime parser
  as there is no error-recovery capability.  

- **absLexer.cs** : contains basic interface and utility classes to be used by
  the automatically generated lexical scanners. RuntimeParser and absLexer define the *Fussless* namespace.

- test1.grammar, calce.grammar, test1main.fs, calcemain.cs: these are
  sample grammars and "main" files that test the parsers and tokenizers
  generated for them.


#### Building Fussless

The system was contructed and tested on Mono and therefore should be
portable to any platform or development setting.

To build the basic Fussless system, do the following once:

1. compile absLexer.cs:  **mcs absLexer.cs /t:library**
2. compile RuntimeParser.fs:  **fsharpc RuntimeParser.fs -a -r absLexer.dll**

This will create absLexer.dll and RuntimeParser.dll that you would use for
every example.

3. Download and build CsLex (generate the lex.exe program).
   *Note: to build CsLex on newer Windows systems, you must manually create the directory lex/bin (or lex\bin) before running nmake in lex/src/.*  The lex.exe file
will be created in the bin directory by nmake.




4. Install Rust (if you don't have it) from rust-lang.org, then install
rustlr with **cargo install rustlr**.   Rustlr is found at [crates.io/crates/rustlr](https://crates.io/crates/rustlr), which also contains links to
a tutorial and its reference documentation.


#### Constructing and testing a parser

To build and test a specific example, do the following:

1. Run **rustlr test1.grammar -fsharp** (with optionally a -o directory/) at a
   shell prompt. This will create a file 'test1parser.fs' and a file 'test1.lex'

2. compile the generated parser: **fsharpc test1parser.fs -r RuntimeParser.dll**

3. Build the generated lexer:
   - lex.exe test1.lex   (where lex.exe is the CsLex executable)
   - mcs test1_lex.cs /t:library /r:absLexer.dll

4. Build and run the test program:
   - **fsharpc test1main.fs -r test1parser.dll -r test1_lex.dll**
   - (mono) test1main.exe  (enter 3+2*5 or similar expression at the prompt)
